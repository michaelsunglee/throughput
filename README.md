# Throughput

Throughput measures the 'playability' of an album. It takes the popularity of each of the songs and calculates their statistical standard deviation. The popularity of an album has no effect on its throughput score. 

This is to highlight how different albums reflect different listening habits, and rewards those where people tend to listen all the way through.
